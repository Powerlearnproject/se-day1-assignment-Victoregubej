# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering is simply put as a systematic application of engineering principles, methods and tools in developing and maintaining software sytem.
software engineering plays a very important role in the technology industry by simplifying the ways or patterns of operations and communication through the creation of software and applications.
Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
creation of operating systems
creation of mobile applications for easy navigation of operations 
creation of web applications 
List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
product design: this is the initial phase of developing a software with covers the use, importance and function of the software.
product development: this involves the core aspectbof creating the software,whereby various tools and methods and applied to achieve the end result.
testing: this is the phase of running the application by the developer and making sure it meets all the requirements involved in the development phase.
deployment:this is the phase of finally introducing the software to the users.
maintaining: this is the phase of correcting, upgrading and improving the content of the software to meet feature demands.
Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
